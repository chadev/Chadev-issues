# Chadev Organizational Branding Guide

This will be used to help decide and document our branding identity.

The correct representation of the title is Chadev, a single word, first letter capitalized, best represented in [chatype](http://chatype.com/ "chatype | the typeface for Chattanooga Tennessee").

For complete branding and style guides, see the [Chadev style guide repo](https://github.com/chadev/style-guide).  Questions and/or suggestions about branding please open an issue in that repo.
