# Chadev Organizational Branding Guide

This will be used to help decide and document our branding identity.

The correct representation of the title is Chadev, a single word, first letter capitalized, best represented in [chatype](http://chatype.com/ "chatype | the typeface for Chattanooga Tennessee").

For complete branding and style guides, see the [Chadev style guide repo](https://github.com/chadev/style-guide).  Questions and/or suggestions about branding please open an issue in that repo.

## Questions remaining:

*   The logo includes brackets, however I'm not sure we want to try to use that everywhere. Opinions?
*   We should set a preference order list as far the availability of alternate names on various social media outlets, i.e.: 
    1.  chadev
    2.  chadevs
    3.  chatdev
    4.  etc, or none of the above.
