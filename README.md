# Chadev issues and ideas

This is a repository for filing issues and ideas for the over all Chadev group.  If there is an issue with the current Chadev community structure; something we are doing wrong, we can improve on, or something we are blatantly just not doing that we should be.  If there is a problem with a community member.  If there is a developer group or an event that we are unaware of then report it here.

Issues pertaining to the Chadev website, or our branding guidelines please open in the appropriate repo to help us keep things organized.
